# internet-MANAGER
CMS system using its own engine based on HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS

This is my own CMS created line by line for website internet MANAGER.
It was working with environment PHP 5.0. Although it didn't use any of SQL database, it was working very well.
The data was storing in regular files crated on server. :)

Now engine needs some changes. Because of lack of global variables in newer instances of PHP it can't work.
For sure one day I will back to this project to prove that I can fix it! :)
